* Display times as hms
* Do something sane with the dialog when no score categories exist
* Import scores from Vala games
* Import scores from /var/games (?)
* Support subcategories of scores (requires converting combo box to menu button)


Integrate with:

* Five or More
* Klotski
* Mahjongg
* Mines
* Tetravex
* Quadrapassel
* Swell Foop
* Nibbles (maybe should use subcategories)
* Tali


Distant Future:

Emit signals during the call to games_scores_add_score, but only once a game is actually going to use the signal. Possibilities:

The "difficulty-suggestion" signal:
    
void user_function (GamesScores *scores, DifficultyLevelSuggestion *suggestion, gpointer user_data);

The "new-player" signal:
    
/* Should this pass the player's name? */
void user_function (GamesScores *scores, gpointer user_data);
