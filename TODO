Tasks for Michael (due ASAP):

* Fix width of scores dialog (Michael)


Tasks for Nikhar (DUE_DATE='23:59 UTC on Monday, August 18')

* Filter categories and display nice category names (requires emitting signal AFTER Context is created)
* Further reduce the space between rows (did this space grow?)
* Use different style for table headings (Rank, Score, and Player)
* Replace close button with Done button (using suggested-action style class) in congratulations mode, and do not allow pressing Enter to close the entry.
* Clean up code; fix anything that looks like bad style, and remove old comments or debugging code
* Fix indentation. No tabs. I know you're using tabs with different editor settings because some of the indentation I see is pretty wild.
* Integrate library with GNOME Mines and GNOME Robots.
  * Submit patches for these games on bugzilla.gnome.org.
  * Respond to code reviews and get patches to accepted status prior to $DUE_DATE.
* libgames-scores code review
  * Ask Michael for code review of libgames-scores. Do this as early as possible. Michael takes time to review.
  * Expect several iterations of review before your code is accepted!
  * Pass by $DUE_DATE. After passing, the repo will be moved to git.gnome.org.


After GSoC (Nikhar or Michael):

* Import scores from Vala games
* Import scores from /var/games (?)
* Support subcategories of scores (requires converting combo box to menu button)


Integrate with:

* Five or More
* Klotski
* Mahjongg
* Tetravex
* Quadrapassel
* Swell Foop
* Nibbles (maybe should use subcategories)
* Tali


Distant Future:

Emit signals during the call to games_scores_add_score, but only once a game is actually going to use the signal. Possibilities:

The "difficulty-suggestion" signal:
    
void user_function (GamesScores *scores, DifficultyLevelSuggestion *suggestion, gpointer user_data);

The "new-player" signal:
    
/* Should this pass the player's name? */
void user_function (GamesScores *scores, gpointer user_data);
