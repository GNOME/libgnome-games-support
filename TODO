Please read through the README. It describes pretty clearly what all we want to do.


API Plan:

We expose only one GObject, GamesScores. It has the following public interface:

/* Called ONCE. */
GamesScores * games_scores_new (const char *app_name, GamesScoresStyle style);

/* If GamesScores does not already know about a category, it is added now. */
gboolean games_scores_add_score (GamesScores *self, gint64 value, const GamesScoresCategory *category);

void games_scores_run_score_dialog (GamesScores *self, GtkWindow *parent, const char *category_description);

Signals should be emitted only during the call to games_scores_add_score:

The "difficulty-suggestion" signal:
    
void user_function (GamesScores *scores, DifficultyLevelSuggestion *suggestion, gpointer user_data);

The "new-player" signal:
    
/* Should this pass the player's name? */
void user_function (GamesScores *scores, gpointer user_data);

Internally, more objects may be needed, such as GamesScore, GamesScoresCategory, and GamesScoresDialog.
