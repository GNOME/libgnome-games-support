/* Time for a history lesson. Once upon a time, scores were stored under
 * /var/games in a format basically the same as what we use now, split into
 * different files based on category. Games were installed setgid for the games
 * group, allowing scores to be shared between users (fun in a computer lab or
 * shared machine) while preventing cheating, since editing the scores file
 * would require some privilege escalation exploit.
 *
 * When Robert started rewriting games in Vala, he changed the scores format so
 * that all scores for a game would be saved in one file, in the home directory.
 * Placing the file in the home directory has an important advantage in that you
 * do not lose your scores if you copy your home directory to another computer.
 * Of course, this had the one-time cost that scores were lost upon upgrading
 * to the new Vala version of the game, as there was no score importer. It also
 * makes importing a bit tricky, because the columns in the scores file are
 * different for each game.
 *
 * Then, for GNOME 3.12, I (Michael) changed all the remaining C games to store
 * scores in the home directory, without changing the format except for removing
 * the player name column, since it didn't seem relevant if all scores were in
 * the home directory. Again, all users' scores were lost in this transition.
 * Currently, scores use this same format, except the player name column is back
 * because it turns out people share user accounts and want to record scores
 * separately.
 *
 * These importers exist so that we don't delete everyone's scores a second
 * time.
 *
 * Some users have complained that scores are now saved in the home directory.
 * Using /var/games was a clever setup and it's a bit of a shame to see it go;
 * bug #749682 exists to restore that old behavior. It has been suggested that
 * we could hardlink scores files from the home directory to /var/games to get
 * the best of both worlds. I don't see why not, except some distro folks really
 * don't like using the setgid bit. Another possibility would be to make this
 * some configurable option. Few enough people have been complaining that I
 * don't plan to spend more time on this, though.
 */

/* Note that importers must operate synchronously. This is fine because the
 * importer is only used before scores are loaded, and we ensure scores are
 * loaded before showing the main window.
