========================

With this release, libgames-support is now entering API freeze in preparation
for its first stable release in March. The API will change before this release
only if a major issue is discovered.

- Add ability to import old scores.
- Various fixes and improvements.
- Various API changes.
- Updated translations

0.2 - October 25, 2015
======================

- API break: replace Context.get_best_n_scores with Context.get_high_scores. The
  new function returns a non-nullable Gee.List (with possibly zero elements)
  rather than a nullable GLib.List (which was never empty if non-null). The
  soname has been bumped, but the pkg-config version remains the same. We
  currently plan to adopt a stable API in February 2016, which will not break
  unless the pkg-config version is changed.
- Style checker should indicate no issues found if patch is clean (Sahil Sareen)
- Updated translations

0.1 - September 21, 2015
